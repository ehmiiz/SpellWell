# SpellWell

`SpellWell` is a CLI application which allows you to practice spelling using your own wordlist.

The workflow is as follows:

1. While working on something and you're unsure of the spelling of a word, you can add it to your wordlist.
2. You type out the looked up word yourself in your desired text editor.
3. After you've reached a few words, you can start practicing spelling them.
4. Add them to the ~/.spellwell file and run the application.
